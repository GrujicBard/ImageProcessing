# Alphabet Recognition Using Scanned Images with R
This project aims to develop an automated alphabet recognition system using the R programming language. The system will be capable of reading scanned alphabet characters, extracting relevant features, and classifying them accurately.
## CharacterExtraction
Preprocess an image containing a grid of alphabet characters and extract individual characters from it. The extracted characters are then saved as separate image files.
## FeatureExtraction
Extract features from individual alphabet characters and prepare a dataset for machine learning tasks. It utilizes the R package "imager" for image processing and the "tidyverse" package for data manipulation.
## Classification
Alphabet letter classification using various machine learning models in the R programming language. It demonstrates how to read in a dataset, preprocess it, train multiple models, and evaluate their performance.
Implements the following machine learning models for classification:
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * Random Forest
  * Neural Network
  * Naive Bayes
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Decision Trees
